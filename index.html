                <h5>Category: <span>Intervention</span></h5>
                <p>Internet Fraud popularly refered to as "Yahoo Yahoo", is gradually becoming a norm in our
                    Present society as People now appreciate and celebrate those who can show-off more than the
                    hard working.
                    For What seem to be a game of been relevant in the Family and the society at large, The
                    Youths are willing to go the extra mile to get that money and funny enough every thing
                    around seems to be singing the same song and telling the same story, a typical example is
                    in the complete Lyrics of a sog by one of the countries porpular artist by the stage name
                    "Small Doctor", a line from on of his hit song which is already a slang used by the general
                    public "...If you no get money, Hide your Face..."<br>
                    Things are going worse by the hour and it seems to me as though nothing is been done to
                    stop or reduce 'INTERNET FRAUD, While I believe the government has to seriously look into
                    this the general public has a bigger role to play!
                    I know thing seems to be very hard as we speak but that should not take our values and
                    culture away, Let's begin to celebrate people for hardwork and excellence and not for
                    Material things gotten illegally - this way we are sending a message to the much younger
                    generation that we (the Society) do not encourage such acts.,<br>
                    More suggested solutions in subsequent reports.
