                        <p>Internet Fraud popularly refered to as "Yahoo Yahoo", is gradually becoming a norm in our
                            Present society as People now appreciate and celebrate those who can show-off more than the
                            hard working.
                            For What seem to be a game of been relevant in the Family and the society at large, The
                            Youths are willing to go the extra mile to get that money and funny enough every thing
                            around seems to be singing the same song and telling the same story, a typical example is
                            in the complete Lyrics of a sog by one of the countries porpular artist by the stage name
                            "Small Doctor", a line from on of his hit song which is already a slang used by the general
                            public "...If you no get money, Hide your Face..."<br>
                            Things are going worse by the hour and it seems to me as though nothing is been done to
                            stop or reduce 'INTERNET FRAUD, While I believe the government has to seriously look into
                            this the general public has a bigger role to play!
                            I know thing seems to be very hard as we speak but that should not take our values and
                            culture away, Let's begin to celebrate people for hardwork and excellence and not for
                            Material things gotten illegally - this way we are sending a message to the much younger
                            generation that we (the Society) do not encourage such acts.,<br>

                    <h3>The Punch Newspaper</h3>
<p class="news">Boko Haram militants attacked an army base in northeast Nigeria, killing one soldier, military sources
    told AFP Friday, a day after regional leaders urged more international support to fight the jihadists.

    Fighters with the Islamic State West Africa Province came in trucks fitted with anti-aircraft guns and attacked the
    base in Arege village near the fishing town of Baga on the shores of Lake Chad.

    The base came under attack before dawn, prompting clashes, a military source told AFP.



    “The attack was successfully repelled but unfortunately a soldier was killed and seven others were injured,” he
    said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the incident. <br><b>Source: </b><a href="https://punchng.com/one-dead-seven-injured-as-boko-haram-attacks-nigerian-army-base/">Punch.ng</a>
